original Sansa bootloader and experimenting on the real HW.  I have never

processors.

I may have understood anything or everything wrong. If you choose to use
this information for any purpose whatsoever you do so on your own
responsibility.



General
-------

The PP5024 seems to include a four channel semi-independent DMA engine.
I am calling it semi-independent because while the DMA engine is
quite programmable and isn't tightly tied to any specific device it
still has some quite interesting limitations. The term is completely
my own, I have no idea whatsoever what it is officially called by PP.

The Sansa e200-series original firmware at least uses one of these
channels to read/write the NAND (+microSD). Maybe one could also be
used to e.g. drive the i2s audio interface etc.



Capabilities/limitations
------------------------

The DMA engine seems to be designed to transfer data between RAM and a
device located in the 0x70000000-0x7000fffc range. It can neither access
the other device spaces below 0x70000000 or above 0xc0000000 nor can it
do pure RAM <-> RAM transfers.

The DMA does not see the remapped memory addresses (unless it can be
activated via some method I do not know about) so a real physical RAM
address has to be used.

Also like usual in PP chips the DMA also is *not* cache coherent (unless
that too can be activated somehow) so the software has to either use
uncached RAM or execute proper cache flushes/invalidates when necessary.



Channels
--------

There are four separate DMA channels available with following register
base adrresses:

channel		base
---------------------------------
0		0x6000b000
1		0x6000b020
2		0x6000b040
3		0x6000b060

From 0x6000b080 onwards there seems to appear mirrors of the real channels.
The number of available channels may be different on some older/newer PP
processors (if available at all).


Generic registers
-----------------

0x6000a000	SIDMA_ENABLE_REG (what does this *really* do?)

	bit 0-31	??
	bit 31		MASTER_ENABLE (1 = DMA enabled)


DMA channel registers
---------------------

BASE+0x00	SIDMA_CMD_REG

	bit 0-15	TRANSFER_SIZE (value + 4 bytes will be transfered)
	bit 16-23	?? (OF uses 0xd)
	bit 24		WAIT_FOR_SDCARD?? (OF uses 1)
	bit 25		WAIT_FOR_??? (OF uses 0)
	bit 26		STOP_ON_COMPLETE (1 = stop, 0 = restart)
	bit 27		DIRECTION (0 = HW -> RAM, 1 = RAM -> HW)
	bit 28		WAIT? (OF uses 0)
	bit 29		?? (OF uses 0)
	bit 30		INTR_ON_COMPLETE (1 = raise intrrupt when done)
	bit 31		TRANSFER_START

	*** If a WAIT_FOR bit is set the DMA seems to wait for something.
	*** Considering that the OF sets bit 24 in NAND DMA transfers my
	*** first (still unproven) guess would be it is waiting for some
	*** HW condition, like e.g. data to appear in the NAND interface
	***  FIFO.
	***
	*** If bit 28 is set and one of the WAIT_FOR bits is also set the
	*** Sansa seems to hang. In my test the source of the transfer is
	*** not properly set up so DMA never completes. Maybe the bit 28
	*** e.g. causes the core to sleep until the DMA is complete and
	*** due to the missing configuration in my test it never will
	*** (just a guess).


BASE+0x04	SIDMA_STATUS_REG

	bit 0-15	TRANSFER_REMAIN (decremented while DMA in progress)
	bit 16-29	??
	bit 30		INTR_PENDING (bit 26 at 0x60004010, read clears)
	bit 31		DMA_ACTIVE (polled by OF)


BASE+0x08	?? (read-only mirror of SIDMA_INCR_REG ?)


BASE+0x0c	?? (read-only mirror of SIDMA_INCR_REG ?)


BASE+0x10	SIDMA_RAMPTR_REG

	bit 0-31	memory address


BASE+0x14	SIDMA_FLAGS_REG

	bits  0-15	unused?
	bits  16-19	?? (0)
	bits  20-23	unused?
	bit   24	IS_ALIGNED?? (is SIDMA_RAMPTR_REG 16-byte aligned)
	bit   25	?? (OF uses 0)
	bit   26	?? (OF uses 1)
	bit   27-31	unused?


BASE+0x18	SIDMA_HWPTR_REG

	bit 0-31	HW register base address (see SIDMA_INCR_REG),
			forced by HW into 0x70000000 - 0x7000fffc range


BASE+0x1c	SIDMA_INCR_REG (OF uses 0x10010000)

	bits  0-15	unused?
	bits  16-18	REG_RANGE (see below)
	bits  19-27	unused?
	bits  28-30	REG_WIDTH (see below)
	bit   31	unused?


REG_RANGE -> 	how many HW registers to use i.e. SIDMA_HWPTR_REG is 
		incremented by 4 after reading/writing 32-bits of data
		until it has been incremented 'range' times at which
		point it is reset back to the original addess

value		range
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
0		unlimited?
1		1 (do not increment)
2		2 (alternate between SIDMA_HWPTR_REG and SIDMA_HWPTR_REG + 4)
3-7		2 ^ (value - 1) [power, not exclusive or]


REG_WIDTH ->	the width of the register access

value		width
--------------------------
0		8-bit
1		16-bit
2		32-bit
3-7		32-bit ?? (I have not seen any difference between 2-7)


Note that using e.g. 16-bit width and register range of 2 seems to
cause the first register to be accessed twice then the second twice,
then the first again twice etc. i.e. the register is incremented only
after 4 bytes, not after every access!





*** The operations below are here just to give an example how the OF
*** uses the DMA engine.


Sansa NAND DMA
--------------

The original Sansa bootloader code uses the DMA channel 0 to handle the
bulk of the NAND transfers. It seems to align the memory buffers by 32
bytes and the HW seems to have some sort of special handling at least
for pointers aligned by 16 bytes.

Consult my "Sandisk E200 series NAND interface" document for details of
the NAND interface if needed.


DMA read setup
--------------

Write the NAND data register address to SIDMA_HWPTR_REG

Write the destination memory address to SIDMA_RAMPTR_REG

Write 0x10010000 to SIDMA_INCR_REG (one 16-bit register)

If memory address is aligned by 16

	Write 0x5000000 to SIDMA_FLAGS_REG

Else

	Write 0x4000000 to SIDMA_FLAGS_REG

Write (0x850d0000 | size) to SIDMA_CMD_REG

Read setup done



DMA write setup
---------------

Write the data register address to SIDMA_HWPTR_REG

Write the destination memory address to SIDMA_RAMPTR_REG

Write 0x10010000 to SIDMA_INCR_REG (one 16-bit register)

If memory address is aligned by 16

	Write 0x5000000 to SIDMA_FLAGS_REG

Else

	Write 0x4000000 to SIDMA_FLAGS_REG

Write (0x8d0d0000 | size) to SIDMA_CMD_REG

Write setup done



DMA wait
--------

Setup the transfer (read/write)

Write 0x80000000 to SIDMA_ENABLE_REG

Wait until SIDMA_STATUS_REG not DMA_ACTIVE (busyloop)

DMA done
