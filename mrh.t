TITLE(MrH)
BOXTOP
<p>
 MrH is an anonymous contributor and the master brain behind most if not all
 of the mi4 reverse engineering process.
<p>
 All Rockbox users on mi4 targets but also on PP targets in general owe him
 for his great work!
<p>
 Let me be clear: MrH exists and I (Daniel) am not him.
