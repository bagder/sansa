WHEREAS the parties shall, for their mutual benefit and in connection with
their cooperation in the development and manufacture of integrated
circuits, exchange and thereby disclose to each other confidential
information, the parties seek to secure the confidentiality of such
information by the terms of and in accordance with this Agreement.

IN CONSIDERATION of such exchange and cooperation IT IS HEREBY AGREED as
follows:

2 Confidentiality

The parties agree to keep all disclosed confidential information strictly
confidential. Without prejudice to the generality of the aforesaid, the
obligation hereunder shall apply in particular to all information which is
marked as being confidential and/or that information, of which within 10
days of its disclosure, notice in writing is given by the disclosing party
that it shall be treated as confidential. The disclosure of such
information should be confirmed in writing. Such information will
ordinarily be disclosed to the other party in written form by way of
software, draft documentation, drawings or technical specifications on data
storage modules such as magnetic tapes or diskettes via data communication
or by post. Data relating to individuals shall (in accordance with
applicable Data Protection laws) also be treated as confidential as will
all information relating to business secrets such as research and
development matters and other business affairs of the other party, its
associated companies or parties contracting with such party.


The confidentiality obligation shall not apply to information which
the parties already hold, without owing any duty of confidentiality, at the
time of disclosure

is in the public domain

the parties legitimately receive from third parties without being subject
to any confidentiality obligations

the parties develop or have developed independently of any such
confidential information

the disclosing party has disclaimed in writing any rights to
confidentiality

are provided after the termination of this Agreement

3 Securing Confidentiality

The parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to maintain confidentiality
and in particular confidential information shall only be given or
communicated to such employees who necessarily and properly require such
information to perform their duties under their employment.

The parties shall keep all documentation and records which contain
confidential information in a secure (locked) and safe place.

4 Acquisition of Information from the Business Operations of the Parties

The parties undertake to keep all internal business information of which
they, their employees or representatives become aware during the
performance of their duties at the other parties' place of business,
strictly confidential and not to divulge the same to any third party. This
shall apply in particular to all internal information relating to
technical, design, manufacture, operational or organisational matters.

5 Extension of the Obligation of Confidentiality to Third Parties

If a party intends to sub-contract to a third party and disclosure of
confidential information to such third party is necessitated thereby, the
party shall first obtain the written consent of the other party thereto.
The disclosing party and the sub-contractor shall prior to such disclosure
enter into a confidentiality agreement in the same form as this Agreement.

If a party is directly or indirectly involved whether through participation
or cooperation in the development and/or production of integrated circuits,
the obligation of confidentiality hereunder shall apply versus the
pertinent business and its employees.

6 Return of the Confidential Documentation

After termination of each contractually separate project, the parties shall
upon request return, destroy or put in safe-keeping specified information.

7 Patentable/Registrable Inventions

The duty of confidentiality also applies to information and documentation
relating to an as yet unregistered or unpatented invention. Such
documentation also constitutes confidential documentation and the party
disclosing the same reserves all rights therein. In particular it is
confirmed that no rights whatsoever are transferred or relinquished to the
other party by the disclosure of such information.

8 General

In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any other
contractual terms between the parties, the terms of this Agreement shall
prevail.

No variation to the terms hereof shall be valid unless such variation is in
writing and signed by a duly authorised representative of each party.

The invalidity of any part of this Agreement shall not affect the validity
of the rest of this Agreement. In the event of any part of this Agreement
being declared invalid or void, the parties shall in good faith negotiate
substitute wording which reflects as far and as near as possible the
parties' initial intention.

9 Law and Jurisdiction

The courts of law in the jurisdiction of the plaintiff shall have exclusive
jurisdiction for any disputes arising herefrom. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction of
the plaintiff.

10 Commencement and Duration of this Agreement

This Agreement shall commence on the later of the two dates of signature of
the parties below being the date when both parties have duly executed this
Agreement. Subject to the following this Agreement shall continue in force
for a period of 7 (seven) years and shall automatically expire thereafter.
Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving to the other 90 days
prior notice thereof in writing. However, the obligations hereunder shall
not be affected by such termination or expiration and shall continue in
full force and effect with respect to information disclosed prior to such
termination or expiration until such time that all information disclosed
hereunder has become public domain by no breach of this agreement.
