The picture to the right was taken by MrH, as the first proof ever of
working LCD code on target.
<p> Daily tip: hold 'menu' for 15 seconds for (HW-based?) power down.

 The first partition is the normal UMS disk while the second one is
magic.

 Note: the Rhapsody models don't have the second parition like this.

<div class="box">
<p>
 Full and more details on Rockbox's <a
href="http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/SansaE200FirmwarePartition">Sansa

E200 Firmware Partition</a> page.
<p> The contents of the second partition is built up like:
<ul>
<li> 0 - 0x1ff header (The first 4 bytes of this dump says "PPBL", at index 4 is the size of the upcoming BL image)
<li> 0x200 -   BL image (padded with zeroes)
<li> 0x80000 - 0x801ff header (The first 4 bytes are "PPMI" and then at index 4 is the size of the upcoming mi4 image)
<li> 0x80200 - mi4 image (padded with zeroes)
<li> end of partition
</ul>
<p> There's a NVPARAMS section. Byte 0x7810e1 determines whether a database
 update is done or not. 1 = update, 0 = don't update.
<p>
 Here's the first dd dumps of mine:<br>
 <a href="sansa-sda2.gz">sansa-sda2.gz</a> 5.3MB (US firmware)
<br> <a href="sansa-sda2-2.gz">sansa-sda2-2.gz</a> 5.3MB (I copied over the
BL* file again without an mi4 file)
<br> <a href="sansa-sda2-3.gz">sansa-sda2-3.gz</a> 5.3MB US firmware signed
with a dummy DSA sig
<p> Try <a href="cutit.c">cutit.c</a> (<a href="cutitc.html">view it</a>) to
extract the mi4 file from the partition. Use mi4code to decrypt it afterwards.
<p>
 The BL has a lot of code in ARM thumb mode. Disassemble with objdump like
this:
<pre>
  arm-elf-objdump -D --target binary -marm -Mforce-thumb BL.rom
</pre>

<div class=title align=left> Running Rockbox on Sansa </div>
<div class="box">
<p>
<a href="http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/SansaE200Install">Install Rockbox on your Sansa e200</a>

</div>
<div class=title align=left> e200tool </div>
<div class="box">
See <a href="e200tool.html">e200tool</a>
</div>
<div class=title align=left> mi4 </div>
<div class="box">
<p>
 On upgrade you put the <tt>PP5022.mi4</tt> on the file system root, but when
 the device upgrades to this it moves it elsewhere and removes it from the
 root filesystem. On other mi4 devices, such as the iriver H10, you put the
 mi4 file in the <tt>/system/</tt> directory and the bootloader loads it
 directly from there...
<p> It seems the Sansa moves the firmware image to a difference place, which
 is accessible through the second partition of the device. In that partition,
 at offset 0x80200, the mi4 file seems to be located.
<p> With a more recent Sansa firmware SanDisk changed the TEA encryption key
(and named their firmware file "<tt>firmware.mi4</tt>"). mi4code is updated to
decrypt both versions fine.
</div>
<div class=title align=left> Sansa Rhapsody </div>
<div class="box">
<p> The Rhapsody version of the Sansa e200 series uses yet another key that
was successfully extracted on February 23, 2007. Use mi4code 0.9.33 or
later. They name the firmware file pp5022.mi4 (note the lower case).
<p> The Rhapsody BL does not allow a "dummy" DSA signed mi4 file to get
loaded.  This means we must either patch the existing BL to allow the loading
of the Rockbox bootloader, or we must "upgrade" the R model BL to a vanilla
Sansa model BL.
<p> Some initial tests of patching the original R BL file (with a .btl
extension) seems to indicate that installing a patch BL file on the R model is
somehow prohibited...
</div>
<a name="usbmodes"></a>
<div class=title align=left> Sansa USB Modes </div>
<div class="box">
<p>
 The Sansas seem to have at least four (4) different USB modes in which it can
 start and allow various kinds of accesses from a host computer:
<ol>
<li> "pre-bootloader" - in which the Sansa appears as a "PortalPlayer USB
Device." - e200tool 0.0.6 and later can (hopefully) access the device in this
mode. A device might stop here due to a corrupted i2c rom.
<li> "Manufacturing" - see below, access it with e200tool. A device might
require this mode due to a corrupted bootloader.
<li> "Recovery" - normal UMS mode but with a 16MB disk in which you can
restore/upgrade mi4 and bootloader images.
<li> "Firmware" - when the normal firmware runs you get to a normal UMS mode
that exposes the whole data partition of the NAND flash.
</ol>
</div>
<div class=title align=left> FM Tuner in Euro version </div>
<div class="box">
<p>
 It has been confirmed by SanDisk that the disabling of the FM tuner in the
 euro version of the player is done in firmware/software.
<p>
 This is contradicted by the people that claim that the euro version has no
radio chip insde... Different HW revisions doing it differently perhaps?
</div>
<div class=title align=left> Recovery Mode </div>
<div class="box">
If you put a bad mi4 on the device it can no longer function properly, but you
must then enter Recovery Mode and correct the bad image.
<ul>
<li> Power off
<li> Turn ON lock/hold
<li> Hold down record
<li> Hit Power/Menu Button
</ul>
<p>
 Note that when I did this, the device appears like this with dmesg:
<pre>
  Vendor: SanDisk   Model: Sansa e250        Rev:
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
SCSI device sda: 32769 512-byte hdwr sectors (17 MB)
sda: assuming Write Enabled
sda: assuming drive cache: write through
 sda: unknown partition table
</pre>
... so there's no partitions but I had to mount /dev/sda instead of /dev/sda1.
<p>
 You then <b>only</b> copy your fine mi4 file to the player,
disconnect USB and it'll use that new mi4.
<p> It seems people have copied all sorts of things to the player in recovery
mode, and then suffered badly.
</div>
<div class=title align=left> Manufacturing Mode </div>
<div class="box">
<p>This mode requires a special driver or tool to access it, and I just got a
complete system lock when I tried it without one!
<ul>
<li> Power off
<li> Turn ON lock/hold
<li> Hold down center select button
<li> Insert USB cable
</ul>
<i>"As of now we can not give out manufacturing mode to anyone outside sandisk
or sandisk vendors"</i> / SanDisk person
<p> <b>MrH</b> has written a tool for addressing and poking on the device
while in manufacturing mode. See the <a
href="e200tool/e200tool-src.zip">e200tool</a>.
<p><b>How to get into Manufacturing Mode on a C200</b>:
<ul>
<li> Power off
<li> Turn ON lock/hold
<li> Hold down DOWN button
<li> Insert USB cable or press menu/on while holding down button
</ul>
